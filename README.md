# emailserver-client
This is a little email server and client I made for opencomputers.
It uses the T3 data card's public/private key encryption.

## Hardware Requirements
### Minimum
* You will need:
* T3 case
* any cpu
* 2x T2 memory (might need less but idk)
* any gpu
* any netork card
* T3 data card

## Running
Both computers require at least the minimum hardware.
If you don't have an account it will ask if you would like to make one.
Due to a bug with opencomputers there is no end to end encryption.

## Installation
Set up the server file on the computer you would like to be the server.
Then run the client from anywhere and sign in with any account.
Then put the corresponding library files into the correspoding lib folders (messageClassClient -> client's lib folder and messageClassServer -> server's lib folder).

## Everything else
If you have any questions let me know and if there are any issues please make sure that they are in the issues tab.
Thanks for downloading my program :).
